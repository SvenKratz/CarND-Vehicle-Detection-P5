This repository contains my solution to the Udacity Self-Driving Car NanoDegree Vehicle Detection Project.

The repository contains the following notable files:

* [Classifier Training and Single Image Pipeline.ipynb](https://github.com/SvenKratz/CarND-Vehicle-Detection-P5/blob/master/Classifier%20Training%20and%20Single%20Image%20Pipeline.ipynb) Jupyter notebook that contains the Python code of the single-image pipelines. It also contains many output images of the pipeline steps.
* [Vehicle Video Detection Pipeline.ipynb](https://github.com/SvenKratz/CarND-Vehicle-Detection-P5/blob/master/Vehicle%20Video%20Detection%20Pipeline.ipynb) Jupyter notebook that contains the Python code of the video vehicle detectio pipeline. 
* [car_detect_output.mp4](car_detect_output.mp4) output video from the video processing pipeline. 
* [writeup.md](writeup.md) Project writeup report.
* `vgg_16_256_64.h5` Model used for feature extraction + classification
